# Experiment #1
## Localhost fetching assets from my website. Will it work?

- Test 1:
  - Pull an entire HTML page
  - Prediction: Not sure if it will work. Guess: It will work
  - Results: Failed

  - Results: Failed
- Test 3:
  - Pull some CSS from assets/CSS
  - Prediction: It will work if test 2 worked (so it won't work)
  - Results: Failed, but could work with a slight modification to the thefactionnexus.tech to allow cross-origin sharing.
- Test 3.5:
  - Pull some CSS from assets/CSS from GitHub Pages version of the same website
  - Prediction: It will work
